"\n",
"Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn\u0027t. However, many renderers -- like Github\u0027s and *FSharp.Formatting* -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. \n",

"Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks \u003ccode\u003e```\u003c/code\u003e, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they\u0027re easier and only they support syntax highlighting.\n",
"\n",

"My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit \u0026lt;Enter\u0026gt; once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens.

"```\n",
"Here\u0027s a line for us to start with.\n",

"This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.\n",
"\n",
"This line is also a separate paragraph, but...\n",
"This line is only separated by a single newline, so it\u0027s a separate line in the *same paragraph*.\n",
